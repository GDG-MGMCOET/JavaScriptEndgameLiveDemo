### 🎯 [View Live Demo Here »](https://gdg-mgmcoet.github.io/JavaScriptEndgameLiveDemo/)

Welcome to the **JavaScript Endgame Live Demo** — a website created to demonstrate **core and advanced JavaScript functionalities** in action.
This project is designed for beginners and enthusiasts who want to explore how JavaScript powers interactivity, logic, and creativity on the web — **using only HTML, CSS, and JS** (no frameworks, no libraries, just pure code).

---

## 🚀 Features Demonstrated

This project covers almost all the key concepts that form the backbone of JavaScript, including:

### 🧩 Core Concepts

* **Variables and Data Types** — `var`, `let`, `const`, strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects
* **Operators** — arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators in action
* **Functions** — traditional, anonymous, and arrow functions
* **Loops** — `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `forEach` loops with real examples
* **Conditional Statements** — `if`, `else if`, `switch`, and ternary usage

### ⚙️ Intermediate & Advanced Concepts

* **Callbacks** — how functions can be passed as arguments and executed dynamically
* **Higher-Order Functions** — examples using `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`
* **Arrow Functions** — simplified syntax with lexical `this` behavior
* **DOM Manipulation** — dynamically changing content, styles, and elements
* **Event Handling** — click, hover, input, and key events

### 🎨 Interactive Demos

* **Animations using JavaScript** — smooth transitions and motion logic with `setInterval()` and `requestAnimationFrame()`
* **Console Demos** — live usage of `console.log()`, `console.table()`, and debugging tools

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** — structure and layout
* **CSS3** — styling and animations
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** — logic, interactivity, and functionality
